 Example of how to setup two swarms in 2D. Both the agent swarm and target swarms are operating with a homogenous set of double integrator dynamic models with the linear quadratic regulator/tracker (L\+QR) controls. The agents are initialized in a uniform distribution, targets are in a fibonacci sphere and the terminal locations are in a circle
