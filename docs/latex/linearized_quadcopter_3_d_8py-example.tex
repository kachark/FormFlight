 Example of how to setup two swarms in 3D. Both the agent and targets swarm are operating with a homogenous set of linearized quadcopter dynamic models with the linear quadratic regulator/tracker (L\+QR) controls. The agents are initialized in a uniform distribution, targets are in a fibonacci sphere and the terminal locations are in a circle
